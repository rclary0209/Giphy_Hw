Gify Read Me

This project takes the category, fit and funny, and creates 10 gifs associated with each topic button. The gifs can be frozen when clicked on and then animated again with another click. Buttons can also be dynamically created by users. The gifs are populated from the API from Giphy. Users can get help with this project by going to the giphy developer website. Giphy maintaines the information provided by their API, however the buttons have been created by myself and additional buttons can be created by users.
